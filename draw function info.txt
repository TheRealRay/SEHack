Hello,

The following is the description of the draw function, draw(objects, beam)

objects coontains an array of objects (defined in objectDefinitions.js). Loop through the loop, and print the objects based on their x and y positions. Please note that the first person is always the person (player). 

Beam contains a single beam object (defined in objectDefinitions.js). The beam object can be printed based on its length and angle (in radians) property.

By the way, y ranges from 10 to -10, and 0 is at the center of the beam. x ranges from 15 to -15, and 0 is at the center of the beam.

Also, if the beam tilts such that the right part points down, its angle is positive.

Please do not worry about the timing for the draw function, as it is called by the physics functions, which are called on a reguler interval.
