Falling objects are of the type Object, and an objects array is contained in the main.js file. This array contains all objects currently on the map.

Each object has an yPos and xPos property. This data can be used to print the objects in the correct location.

The range of yPos is 10 to -10. The range of xPos is 15 to -15.

Also, the balance beam can be printed based on its angle (in radians) and length properties.

Peace.
